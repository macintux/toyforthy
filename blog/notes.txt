* Start with pattern matching
* Talk about the pain of one wall of text with so much boilerplate,
  despite how easy the code is to write
* Highlight the pain of adding a new parameter (Words) to every branch
* Highlight the pain of adding useful error messages
* Talk about the switch to a dictionary of lambdas.
  * Making evaluate one argument so I can pass the results from interpret directly
* Early mistake in defining the word dictionary: copying the same
  patterns from the function heads. Stupid, copying all that
  boilerplate, just make each function take the arguments it needs.

"When your favorite tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
(I do love pattern matching.)

* How to pass arguments? List or individually? Obviously easier as a list.
* Problem of how to update the words dictionary. Options:
  * Every otherwise-simple function in the word dictionary takes and
    returns the dictionary
  * Every otherwise-simple function returns a flag indicating whether
    the result should be added to the dictionary.
  * Only the word definition function updates the word dictionary
    * Ha, j/k, can't do that in Erlang

  = So the functions started out taking 2 arguments (stack values and
    stacks to pattern match the returning values) and eventually took
    2 arguments (stack values and word dictionary)

* Had to change the return values from the lambdas *AGAIN* once I got
  to `dup` because it had to return 2 values to put at the top of the
  stack, not just 1.

* So after each tweak it gets a little more complex, but the end
  result is still fairly tidy, especially when laid out neatly:

       {"+",     {2,   fun([A, B], W) -> {[B+A], W} end}},
       {"-",     {2,   fun([A, B], W) -> {[B-A], W} end}},
       {"*",     {2,   fun([A, B], W) -> {[B*A], W} end}},
       {"/",     {2,   fun([A, B], W) -> {[B div A], W} end}},
       {"dup",   {1,   fun([A], W)    -> {[A, A], W} end}},
       {"swap",  {2,   fun([A, B], W) -> {[B, A], W} end}},
       {"over",  {2,   fun([A, B], W) -> {[B, A, B], W} end}},

  ...and then we hit word definition and I realize there is no static arity!

  However, we can overload that arity element of the tuple.

  Then I realize that the Exercism test code actually gives me an easy
  out: each time a new word is defined, it is passed as an independent
  string. But, I don't want to take this cheat if I can avoid it; I'd
  rather follow the Forth "standard" (a topic deserving a blog post by
  someone who understands Forth, and I should find one to link here).

  I also need to figure out why my code was working when the strings
  sent to evaluate/1 are actually a list of strings; somehow I'd
  overlooked that but my code worked anyway...why?

      * Just because, that's why. string:split handles it gracefully.

> string:split(["foo bar", "baz", "a b c d"], " ", all).
["foo","barbaza","b","c","d"]
        ^^^^^^^
        Oops, Not so gracefully. I'm going to have to mangle my input
        to treat it as one stream.

        I'm reminded how awkward string processing can be in
        Erlang. Perl, wherefore art thou?

  So I decide at this point I should save my sanity and test the code
  as I have it before I define words.

==== Words!

My initial plan was to maintain the two-element tuple structure

Add to my default words:
       {";",     {fun(S) -> look_for(":", S, []) end,
                  fun define_word/2}}

And to interpret as a new head:
interpret(_Next, {ok, {StackFun, ExecuteFun}}, RemainingInputs, Stack, Words)
  when is_function(StackFun) ->
    {ToProcess, StackTail} = StackFun(Stack),
    {Result, NewWords} = ExecuteFun(ToProcess, Words),
    {RemainingInputs, Result ++ StackTail, NewWords};

And this would work, but what I quickly realized is that to support
the new words I would need an entirely new execution structure. How do
I know the arity of a user-defined word? I don't.

A new word is effectively a way of saying "When you see this word,
replace it with these other words", at least for the purposes of this
tiny Forth implementation.

So for new words, I don't need to touch the accumulated stack;
instead, I can just put the replacement words back onto my input queue
(in the correct order) and return to real_evaluate.

And perhaps the "new word" word (": ... ;", whatever Forth users call
that structure) could be interpreted using this new flow. Instead of
just continuing to throw things onto the stack after I see ":" and
wait for ";", I could process the inputs in a separate function and
leave the stack untouched.

But after writing the idea down, I realized what I was proposing was
creating a *new*, special case, temporary stack, and that feels wrong.

So I'm back to the question: how do I represent the new arbitrary
functions in my data structure?

Answer: my outer tuple will be a word and a list, instead of a word and a tuple.

interpret(_Next, {ok, ReplacementWords}, RemainingInputs, Stack, Words)
  when is_list(ReplacementWords) ->
    {ReplacementWords ++ RemainingInputs, Stack, Words};

Effectively I find myself bouncing between, and updating, three
structures when I'm trying to sort out the data flow: the function I'm
adding to process the input (define_word/2 in this case), the data
structure I'm manipulating, and the documentation describing all of
the above.

Everything works, except it doesn't. Sometimes my word definition
works, sometimes I end up in an infinite loop, and I haven't figured
out why using the old "print everything out" strategy. Time to build
and deploy redbug.

Well, that was entertaining. It's been so long since I've done any
work on Erlang, and even longer since I've had to set up my own
environment instead of relying on the infrastructure Basho had
configured before I ever started there, that it took me a good half
hour just to get redbug installed in my path.

Discovered that it has been extracted from eper.

Could have used rebar to automatically load it but didn't want to open
that can of worms yet.

* Remember to use kerl (add a default invocation to my bash_profile)
* Download and make it
* Run erl, get code path, discover that it won't show me the whole data structure, reconstruct how to iterate over it and print each component (too much Python)
  * lists:foreach(fun(P) -> io:format("~s~n", [P]) end, code:get_path()).
    * lists:foreach(lambda p..wait, no
    * lists:foreach(fun(p) -> io:format("~s~n", [p]) end, code:get_path()).
      * No, wait, that also fails with some really perverse error message
      * finally remember
    * lists:foreach(fun(P) -> io:format("~s~n", [P]) end, code:get_path()).
* Discover there's nothing in there equivalent to "site_lib" in Python/Perl
* Configure ERL_LIBS in my bash_profile, but to the directory with the beams
  * export ERL_LIBS="/Users/jdaily/github/redbug/_build/default/lib/redbug/ebin"
* Run erl again
* Run above foreach loop
* Don't see the directory
* Keep experimenting, keep reading online
* Find https://stevemorin.blogspot.com/2011/07/erlang-module-load-path-how-to-erllibs.html
  * "NOTE:the lib path will not load if it doesn't contain a ebin dir"
* Change ERL_LIBS
  * export ERL_LIBS="/Users/jdaily/github/redbug/_build/default/lib/redbug"
* NOW it works

Except it doesn't.

redbug:start("forth:look_for->return").
redbug:start("forth:look_for->return").
** exception error: undefined function redbug:start/1
21> m(redbug).
m(redbug).
** exception error: undefined function redbug:module_info/0
     in function  c:m/1 (c.erl, line 722)
22>

dafuq?

Guess what?

ERL_LIB has to point to the directory containing ebin. code:add_path/1
(or code:add_patha/1 which I used) has to point to the ebin directory
itself. MADNESS.

Anyway.

Now I can troubleshoot this.

> redbug:start("forth:look_for->return").
redbug:start("forth:look_for->return").
{45,1}
> forth:evaluate(["1 : dupw dup ; dupw"]).


% 20:49:35 <0.88.0>({erlang,apply,2})
% forth:look_for(":", ["dupw","dupw",":",1], [])

% 20:49:35 <0.88.0>(dead)
% forth:look_for(":", ["dupw",":",1], ["dupw"])

% 20:49:35 <0.88.0>(dead)
% forth:look_for(":", [":",1], ["dupw","dupw"])

% 20:49:35 <0.88.0>(dead)
% forth:look_for/3 -> {["dupw","dupw"],[1]}

% 20:49:35 <0.88.0>(dead)
% forth:look_for/3 -> {["dupw","dupw"],[1]}

% 20:49:35 <0.88.0>(dead)
% forth:look_for/3 -> {["dupw","dupw"],[1]}

I had to re-read this a few times before I finally got the joke.

My code was doing exactly what I told it to, like it always does.

By the time I saw the ";" to end the word definition and invoked
look_for/3 to find the originating ":", I had already processed a
"dup" on "dupw". So instead of "dupw" being an alias to "dup", it was
an alias to itself, hence my infinite loop.

One approach would be to intercept the ":" that starts the word
definition and put the interpreter into a special mode that wouldn't
invoke any words it recognized, just put them on the stack. Let's see
how that might work.

One of the joys of Erlang, and FP in general, is a lack of mutable
globals. When you call a function, it should always give you back the
same results for the same inputs.

And you don't typically have global variables as a "hidden" input.

So for interpret/4 to know that we're no longer in "run" mode but our
new "define" mode, we need yet another parameter to the function, to
make it interpret/5.

(There are other options, such as dropping a mode setting into the
Words dictionary, but that would be the sort of ugly thing you'd do as
an emergency bug fix in a production environment while you work out
the real solution.)

...starting to look like an FSM.

Ok, attempt #2. Let's switch from interpret/5 to a new accumulating function when we see ":". We define a new function head for interpret/5 for just a function as the action part of the words tuple, and like interpret itself, we need the function to report back what's left of the inputs, what the new stack looks like, and the new words dictionary.


We call the binding, appropriately enough, `BypassFun`; it operates as
its own variant of the interpret/5 function, bypassing it temporarily.

Will we need this pattern for anything other than word definition? Well, definitely not for the scope of this project.

Actually, we *don't* need the stack at all. Consider removing it, but leaving it available for the function makes it more general.

Again, this probably should be a FSM. `accumulate/6` uses the last parameter and first parameter combined as a decision parameter.
